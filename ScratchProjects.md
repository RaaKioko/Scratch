# My Scratch Projects

A collection of games and experiments I made in my childhood since 2020 or so.

## Projects

- [Statistics calculator](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/984165933/)  
  Me and my classmates used this in highschool :D

- [Battleship game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/659452876/)  
  Singleplayer game of battleship. Yet to implement ship designs, but it works great and smoothly

- [Plants vs Zombies Game Recreation](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/569153195/)  
  Greatly downscaled version of plants vs zombies 2

- [Keyboard (Piano)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/586712753/)  
  Play piano on it

- [Story of Halloween](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/581907857/)  
  This story, as in the storyline is actually from a cartoon called The Bread Barber Shop

- [Bounce game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/578294964/)  
  I made it after Atari breakout because i thought it would be fun as a 2 player game, and it is. I came up with it myself and I've been proud of it's originality until I found out it is just a vertical instead of horizontal game of pong

- [Panzer Battle Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/560600053/)  
  The singleplayer is kinda broken. But the 2 player is fun and works without issues. It is a recreation of panzer battle i used to play on my parents' Sony Bravia TV as an even younger child until they discontinued it and i decided to make it for myself.

- [Draw and simulate ball physics](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/563630400/)  
  You get to draw whatever u want using a drawing editor and then simulate balls interacting with it with bounce and gravity modifiers

- ["Basketball"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/560574739/)  
  Shoot basketballs into a hoop

- [Chase game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/558460163/)  
  Pretty old and basic game where enemies chase you until you make it to the end. If they touch you, you lose. Low quality but fun

- [Calculator](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/557217554/)  
  Old calculator I made using scratch operators. I made a way better one using Microsoft Access

- [Racing game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/555070892/)  
  Race an opponent car round an oval track for 3 laps. I remember feeling really smart when making code to prevent you cutting across and cheating to complete a lap. You can cut across still, but the lap won't count

- [Self-generating level game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/552833734/)  
  This was made before I knew how falling worked, so in game you fall at a slow constant speed rather than accelerate. Still a fun scenic concept. And the tutorial I made for it was hands down super polished

- [Atari Breakout Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/381555601/)  
  Recreation of the classic game Atari Breakout

- [Tank Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/541368838/)  
  A tank shooter game. The opponents have aimbot but have random movement except in the capture the flag mode. To balance random movement I gave them more health than the player. Fun game with 3 maps I made myself
